Welcome all,

We have designed this project to help developers like us. 
who are spending most of their time in debugging the code.

Why should we code to test a method, 
why not use reflection. based on this idea only this project was built.

 
# DMH [Debug Method Helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BalajiPriya.DebugMethodHelper)

## Extension for Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019 & 2019 community edition 

Follow all the simple steps once and you don't want to write any code after to test your methods.

Steps to follow:
1. Download [DMH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BalajiPriya.DebugMethodHelper) and install this extension for Visual studio 2015/2017/2019 & 2019 community edition, else open visual studio and open extensions window and search for DMH and download fist item.
2. Restart Visual studio and open your c# project.
3. Right-click on any method and click "debug method"

4. Resolve dependency Interface using UI Map dependency/skip all dependency/map by code(using autofac etc.),
![](/src/DMH.Net/help/image1.png)

5. You can skip all dependency and Map your Interface by code, like you do for your test project,
![](/src/DMH.Net/help/image2.png)

If you project is big and you cannot map using UI then this way of mapping will be really helpful.

### (note: please don't change namespace(LouckHome), class and method name else auto mapping will not work)

```
//Add this code in your startup project selected in UI
using Autofac;//optional based on reliever you are using

namespace LuckyHome//do change else we cannot find
{
    public class LuckyHomeInterfaceClassMapper
    {
        private readonly static ILifetimeScope scope;

        static LuckyHomeInterfaceClassMapper()
        {
            HttpConfiguration config = new HttpConfiguration();
            scope = AutofacConfig.Register(config, false).BeginLifetimeScope();
	          //AutofacConfig.Register class is some thing you have to create and register your dependency
	    //In you case you can have different class name or different way of registering, you can do it that way.
	    
            //not only autofac you can use any resolver
            //If you want you can even do mock for some type
        }
	//where in Run method input type will be of interface and output object you have to resolver and send back as class.
        public object Run(Type type/*interface*/)
        {
            var output = scope.Resolve(type);
            //If you want you can even do mock for some type
            if (output == null)
            {
            }
            return output;//class

        }
    }
}
```
6. Set input parameter values for that method

7. Startup Project config will be used by default if you want you can also use a custom config
For custom config create new file name "luckyhome.config" in startup project output directory and add you configuration

8. Start debugging in few seconds

![](src/DMH.Net/help/image5.png)

Not just for web services or web API it supports all frameworks written in c#.

### we also give support for dotnet Core version 2.1 & 3.1

To get Core Dependency supported please use below code.

### (note: please don't change namespace(LouckHome), class and method name else auto mapping will not work)

```
//Add this code in your startup project selected in UI
namespace LuckyHome
{
    public class LuckyHomeInterfaceClassMapper
    {
        // private readonly static ILifetimeScope scope;
        //static IConfiguration configuration;
        private static IServiceProvider serviceProvider;
        
         static LuckyHomeInterfaceClassMapper()
        {
            var services = new ServiceCollection();
	    
            IConfiguration tempIConfiguration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
              .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: false)
              .AddUserSecrets("e3dfcccf-0cb3-423a-b302-e3e92e95c128")
              .AddEnvironmentVariables()
              .Build();
            
            services.AddScoped<IConfiguration>(_ => tempIConfiguration);
            //services.AddTransient<IframeInterface, FrameInterface>(); //based on you class and interface name input will change
	    
            // Simple configuration object injection (no IOptions<T>)
            //services.Configure<PositionOptions>(tempIConfiguration.GetSection(
            //                                        PositionOptions.Position));//based on Configuration class name input will change
	    
            services.AddLogging(builder => builder.AddConsole());
            
            serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
        }

        public object Run(Type type)
        {
            object output = serviceProvider.GetService(type);
            if (output == null)
            {
                output = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService(type);
                if (output == null)
                    throw new NotImplementedException();
            }
            return output;
        }
    }
}
```
appsettings.json change the property to copy to output directory

Finally edit core project csproj file to run in windows 10 by adding this code.
```
 <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|AnyCPU'">
    <RuntimeIdentifier>win10-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```
Please share your valuable feedback, 
Thanks in advance.
